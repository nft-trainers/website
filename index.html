        <div class="box"><p>Not only are Trainers full of nostalgia and creativity, but they'll also pay homage to the original CryptoPunks NFT by remaining in their sprite forms as well as having some guest appearances from the Zombie, Ape and Alien variants!</p><i></i></div>

      <div class="row section">
        <div class="box"><p>Each Trainer is individually crafted to have a near endless number of combinations such as hair and clothing styles/colors, gender, poses, backgrounds, throwing balls and more to truly shake things up and be unique to each and every owner. Who knows, maybe you'll even spot some cultural icons along the way!</p><i></i></div>

        <div class="box"><p>There will only ever be 100 Trainers created with the exception of a few surprise Trainers distributed via lottery and other methods to some of our most fierce collectors. As such, the purchase price will increase with a bonding curve to reward early investors. By design, most of our Trainers will be priced under 0.2 ETH.</p>

        <div class="box"><p>Trainers is the FIRST of its kind and also the FIRST Pokemon-related NFT not to focus on the actual Pokemon. It makes us unique and hopefully cements us within NFT history. Collecting and trading Trainers will also be made fun and engaging as different events and airdrops will occur for our followers and collectors! Plus, who knows? Maybe your Trainer will be worth thousands or millions in the future.</p><i></i></div>

        <h5 class="faq-heading">Will prices ever change?</h5>
        <div class="box"><p>Our community comes first and if there's ever a need to adjust the bonding curve, we will let everyone know in advance. That being said, the current bonding curve is extremely generous!</p><i></i></div>

      <div class="row section">
        <h5 class="faq-heading">When do drops happen?</h5>

        <h5 class="faq-heading">What kind of events are in store?</h5>

        <h5 class="faq-heading">Is this a good investment?</h5>
        <div class="box"><p>With any NFT, there is always the risk of your investment not growing. We're hoping that we can engage with our community and create master quality Trainers so that they'll continue to grow more and more valuable. As always, use your best judgment and don't spend what you don't have!</p><i></i></div>
